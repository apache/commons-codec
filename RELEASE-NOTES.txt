The codec package contains simple encoder and decoders for
various formats such as Base64 and Hexadecimal. In addition to these
widely used encoders and decoders, the codec package also maintains a
collection of phonetic encoding utilities.

Changes in this version include:

o org.apache.commons.codec.language.RefinedSoundex.US_ENGLISH_MAPPING should be package protected MALICIOUS_CODE.  Issue: CODEC-113. Thanks to ggregory. 
o org.apache.commons.codec.language.Soundex.US_ENGLISH_MAPPING should be package protected MALICIOUS_CODE.  Issue: CODEC-114. Thanks to ggregory.

o Many test cases use getBytes() which uses the default platform encoding so tests may fail on some platforms.  Issue: CODEC-92. 
o Base64 default constructor behaviour changed to enable chunking in 1.4.  Issue: CODEC-97. Thanks to mjryall. 
o Base64.encodeBase64String() shouldn't chunk.  Issue: CODEC-99. Thanks to julius. 
o Base64InputStream#read(byte[]) incorrectly returns 0 at end of any stream which is multiple of 3 bytes long.  Issue: CODEC-101. Thanks to balusc. 
o Typo in DecoderException message thrown from Hex.decodeHex.  Issue: CODEC-103. Thanks to gnuf. 
o Caverphone encodes names starting and ending with "mb" incorrectly.  Issue: CODEC-117. Thanks to ggregory. 

Removed:
o Remove deprecated package private method Base64.discardWhitespace(byte[])  Issue: CODEC-116. Thanks to ggregory. 

Have fun!

Commons Codec Package Version 1.3 Release Notes

  New Features:

o BinaryCodec: Encodes and decodes binary to and from Strings of 0s and 1s. 
  Issue: 27813. Thanks to Alex Karasulu. 
o QuotedPrintableCodec: Codec for RFC 1521 MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail 
  Extensions) Part One. Rules #3, #4, and #5 of the quoted-printable spec are 
  not implemented yet. See also issue 27789. Issue: 26617. Thanks to Oleg 
  Kalnichevski. 
o BCodec: Identical to the Base64 encoding defined by RFC 1521 and allows a 
  character set to be specified. Issue: 26617. Thanks to Oleg Kalnichevski. 
o QCodec: Similar to the Quoted-Printable content-transfer-encoding defined 
  in RFC 1521 and designed to allow text containing mostly ASCII characters 
  to be decipherable on an ASCII terminal without decoding. Issue: 26617. 
  Thanks to Oleg Kalnichevski. 
o Soundex: Implemented the DIFFERENCE algorithm. Issue: 25243. Thanks to 
  Matthew Inger. 
o RefinedSoundex: Implemented the DIFFERENCE algorithm. Issue: 25243. Thanks 
  to Matthew Inger. 

  Fixed bugs:

o The default URL encoding logic was broken. Issue: 25995. Thanks to Oleg 
  Kalnichevski. 
o Base64 chunked encoding not compliant with RFC 2045 section 2.1 CRLF. 
  Issue: 27781. Thanks to Gary D. Gregory. 
o Hex converts illegal characters to 255. Issue: 28455. 
o Metaphone now correctly handles a silent B in a word that ends in MB. 
  "COMB" is encoded as "KM", before this fix "COMB" was encoded as "KMB". 
  Issue: 28457. 
o Added missing tags in Javadoc comments. 
o General Javadoc improvements. 

  Changes:

o This version is relesed under the Apache License 2.0 , please see 
  LICENSE.txt. Previous versions were released under the Apache License 1.1. 
o The Board recommendation to remove Javadoc author tags has been 
  implemented. All author tags are now "Apache Software Foundation".

Commons Codec Package Version 1.2 Release Notes

NEW FEATURES:

* URLCodec - Implements the 'www-form-urlencoded' encoding scheme

* DigestUtils - Simple utility class that provides static convenience
  methods for calculating md5 and hex digests.


BUG FIXES:

* Fix for Bug 19860: Modified Base64 to remedy non-compliance with RFC
  2045.  Non-Base64 characters were not being discarded during the
  decode.  RFC 2045 explicitly states that all characters outside of the
  base64 alphabet are to be ignored.  

* Fix for Bug 24360: Hex.decode(Object) throws a ClassCastException 
  when a String argument is passed in.
  
* Fix for Bug 24471: Soundex: The HW rule is not applied; hyphens and 
  apostrophes are not ignored.
  
* Fix for Bug 24484: Soundex.setMaxLength causes bugs and is not needed.
  Calling Soundex.setMaxLength() with a value of 2 or less causes the wrong
  answer to be returned.  Since the encoding returned by Soundex is always
  of length 4 by definition (we do not use the '-' in as a letter-nnn 
  separator) the need for a maxLength attribute is not needed.  Deprecate 
  the field and accessor methods.

* Fix in Metaphone relating to the handling of the maximum code length.

Commons Codec Package Version 1.1 Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Codec package, and highlights changes since the previous version.  Version
1.1 is the first official release of Codec.  Numerous projects had been 
depending on Version 1.0-dev while Codec was in the Sandbox, and backwards
compatibility has been preserved to ease the transition to this official
release. 

NEW FEATURES:

* A newer version of the Base64 class reflecting improvements from
  both the commons-httpclient and xml-rpc versions of code forked
  from catalina.
* Base64 class from commons-httpclient in org.apache.commons.codec.base64
  has been retained for backwards compatibility but has been deprecated
* Soundex class from commons-util in org.apache.commons.codec
* Metaphone class from commons-util in org.apache.commons.codec
* RefinedSoundex class in org.apache.commons.codec
* Encoder/Decoder interfaces in org.apache.commons
* String and Binary specific Encoder/Decoder interfaces in 
  org.apache.commons
* StringEncoderComparator replaces the SoundexComparator from the
  language package.

BUG FIXES:

* Base64 now discards whitespace characters when decoding encoded
  content.
