INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Codec package, and highlights changes since the previous version.  The
current release adds new features and bug fixes, and is being done now to

  both the commons-httpclient and xml-rpc versions of code forked
  from catalina.

  has been retained for backwards compatibility but has been deprecated
* Soundex class from commons-util in org.apache.commons.codec
* Metaphone class from commons-util in org.apache.commons.codec
* RefinedSoundex class in org.apache.commons.codec
* Encoder/Decoder interfaces in org.apache.commons
* String and Binary specific Encoder/Decoder interfaces in 
  org.apache.commons
* StringEncoderComparator replaces the SoundexComparator from the
  language package.

BUG FIXES:

* Base64 now discards whitespace characters when decoding encoded
  content.
