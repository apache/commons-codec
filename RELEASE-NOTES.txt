			Commons Codec Package
			    Version 1.1.1
			    Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Codec package, and highlights changes since the previous version.  Version
1.1.1 contains a bug fix for the 1.1 release, and addresses an issue related
to the treat of non-Base64 characters.


NEW FEATURES:

* None

BUG FIXES:

* Fix for Bug 19860: Modified Base64 to remedy non-compliance with RFC
  2045.  Non-Base64 characters were not being discarded during the
  decode.  RFC 2045 explicitly states that all characters outside of the
  base64 alphabet are to be ignored.  A new function discardNonBase64 is
  called prior to a decode.  Note that isArrayBase64 only discards
  whitespace before testing the contents of an encoded byte array.  Unit
  tests for Base64 were updated to reflect the changes related to
  discarding non-Base64 characters.
