			Commons Codec Package
			    Version 1.2
			    Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Codec package, and highlights changes since the previous version.  Version
1.2 contains bug fixes for the 1.1 release, including an issue related
to the treat of non-Base64 characters, Soundex fixes and adds the 
org.apache.commons.codec.net package.


NEW FEATURES:

* org.apache.commons.codec.net: A new package with the class URLCodec.


BUG FIXES:

* Fix for Bug 19860: Modified Base64 to remedy non-compliance with RFC
  2045.  Non-Base64 characters were not being discarded during the
  decode.  RFC 2045 explicitly states that all characters outside of the
  base64 alphabet are to be ignored.  A new function discardNonBase64 is
  called prior to a decode.  Note that isArrayBase64 only discards
  white space before testing the contents of an encoded byte array.  Unit
  tests for Base64 were updated to reflect the changes related to
  discarding non-Base64 characters.

* Fix for Bug 24360: Hex.decode(Object) throws a ClassCastException 
  when a String argument is passed in.
  
* Fix for Bug 24471: Soundex: The HW rule is not applied; hyphens and 
  apostrophes are not ignored.
  
* Fix for Bug 24484: Soundex.setMaxLength causes bugs and is not needed.
  Calling Soundex.setMaxLength() with a value of 2 or less causes the wrong
  answer to be returned.  Since the encoding returned by Soundex is always
  of length 4 by definition (we do not use the '-' in as a letter-nnn 
  separator) the need for a maxLength attribute is not needed.  Deprecate 
  the field and accessor methods.
