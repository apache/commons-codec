            Modified Base64 to remedy non-compliance with RFC
            2045.  Non-Base64 characters were not being discarded during the
            decode.  RFC 2045 explicitly states that all characters outside of the
            base64 alphabet are to be ignored.

      	    </action>
			<action dev="ggregory" type="fix" issue="24484">
            Soundex.setMaxLength causes bugs and is not needed.
            Calling Soundex.setMaxLength() with a value of 2 or less causes the wrong
            answer to be returned.  Since the encoding returned by Soundex is always
            of length 4 by definition (we do not use the '-' in as a letter-nnn 
            separator) the need for a maxLength attribute is not needed.  Deprecate 
            the field and accessor methods.
