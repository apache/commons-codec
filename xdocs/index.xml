Commons Codec provides implementations of common encoders and decoders
such as Base64, Hex, Phonetic and URLs.

<p>
Codec was formed as an attempt to focus development effort on one
definitive implementation of the Base64 encoder.  At the time of
Codec's proposal, there were approximately 34 different Java
classes that dealt with Base64 encoding spread over the
Foundation's CVS repository.  Developers in the Jakarta Tomcat
project had implemented an original version of the Base64 codec
which had been copied by the Commons HttpClient and Apache XML
project's XML-RPC subproject.  After almost one year, the two
forked versions of Base64 had significantly diverged from one
another.  XML-RPC had applied numerous fixes and patches which
were not applied to the Commons HttpClient Base64.  Different 
subprojects had differing implementations at various levels
of compliance with the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt">
RFC 2045</a>.
</p>
<p>
Out of that confusing duplication of effort sprang this simple
attempt to encourage code reuse among various projects.  While
this package contains a abstract framework for the creation of
encoders and decoders, Codec itself is primarily focused on
providing functional utilities for working with common encodings.
