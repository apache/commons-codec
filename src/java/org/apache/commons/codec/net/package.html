  Network related encoding and decoding.
  <p>
  Currently, the only codec in this package is URLCodec, which
  implements encoding and decoding for www-form-urlencoded,
  also known as URL-Encoding.  The source for URLCodec provides
  detailed comments.

  Ideas for other net codec are encouraged ;)
